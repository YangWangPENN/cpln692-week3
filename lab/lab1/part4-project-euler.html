    # Lab 1, Part 4 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project
    Euler. Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science
    problems that can be solved using any language (for our class, use
    Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives
    (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you will
    be able to submit your final result.

    If you complete problem 1, move on to problem 2!

    /* =====================

    Start code

    ===================== */

    /*problem 1
    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
    get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.*/

    var array = [];
    let sum = 0;
    for(var i=0; i<1000; i++) {
      if (i%3 === 0 || i%5 === 0) {
        array.push(i);
        sum += i;
      }
    };

    console.log(sum);

    /*problem 2
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
    two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
    exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.*/

    let evenSum = 0;
    let fibArray = [1,2];
    var x=0;
    var y=0;

    while (fibArray[0] < 4000000) {
      for (var j=0; j<1; j++) {
        if (fibArray[j]%2 === 0) {
          evenSum += fibArray[j];
        }
      }
      x=fibArray[0];
      y=fibArray[1];
      fibArray[0]=x+y;
      fibArray[1]=fibArray[0]+y;
    };

    console.log(evenSum);
